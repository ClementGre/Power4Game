# Power4Game


## Overview

This is a simple Power4 game in Python, with a Tkinter GUI and a robot to play with.
It is not possible to play with a friend on the same computer, but you can play against the robot.

This game was developed with three friends as a project in my school.

## Run the game

To run the game, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your computer.

Then, you can run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
